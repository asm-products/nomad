This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/nomad](https://assembly.com/nomad).

## Installing

This is the Nomad's web API repository, if you are looking for the mobile apps you should go to the [iOS](https://github.com/asm-products/nomad-ios) or [Android](https://github.com/asm-products/nomad-android) repositories.

This tutorial is based on a MacOS installation, but it should work on Linux and Windows as well. You can go to [Nomad chat](https://assembly.com/chat/nomad) if you need any help to setup your machine.

We recommend using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Fig](http://www.fig.sh/index.html) to setup your development environment.

### Docker

Docker is a lightweight solution to isolate the application's dependencies while running on the development environment. It means that it doesn't matter if you are a Mac, Linux or Windows user, everybody can easily run Nomad on their own machines and contribute.

In order to install Docker, follow [this tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) and come back here for the next step.

At some point, Docker installation guide will ask you to run ```docker run hello-world``` inside a Docker terminal. After doing it Docker will say something like:

```
To connect the Docker client to the Docker daemon, please set:
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/nicolasiensen/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
```

Don't skip this step, it'll be important later.

### Fig

Fig allows you to describe the application dependencies, and with a simple ```fig up``` it builds, on top of Docker, your environment on an isolated virtual machine.

Follow [this tutorial](http://www.fig.sh/install.html) to get Fig installed, once it's done you can run ```fig up``` and all the black magic will start. I advise you to grab a cup of coffee now cause it could take a long time, but don't close this page, we are not done yet.

If everything goes right you will end up with a Docker virtual machine running a web and a database processes (WEBrick and PostgreSQL).

Open a new terminal tab and type ```boot2docker ip```. In my case I got ```192.168.59.103```, so if I enter ```http://192.168.59.103:3000/``` in the browser it'll load the Nomad with errors.

The next step is to create the database. You will need to copy the sample database.yml file; in the project root directory, run ```cp config/database.sample.yml config/database.yml```. In the same terminal run ```fig run web rake db:create``` followed by ```fig run web rake db:migrate```.

Now reload your browser and you should be presented with the default Rails index page, it means that you have everything up and running.

## API Documentation

### Authentication

Most of this API is publicly accessible, but some methods require a [HTTP token](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Token.html) for authentication. In order to get one of those tokens, you have to create an user, every user have an automatically generated attribute called ```api_token``` which grants access to authenticated API methods.

### Methods

#### places/search

Returns all places in the given area ordered by distance.

```
GET /api/v1/places/search/:radius/:lat/:lng.json
```

* ```radius```: integer representing how much meters to cover
* ```lat```: float number for latitude
* ```lng```: float number for longitude

Example: https://asm-nomad-staging.herokuapp.com/api/v1/places/search/1000/-23.0045582/-43.324637.json

#### places/show

Returns the place data for the given place id.

```
GET /api/v1/places/:id.json
```

* ```id```: integer for the respective place id

Example: https://asm-nomad-staging.herokuapp.com/api/v1/places/1.json

#### reviews/create (requires authentication)

Create a new review.

```
POST /api/v1/reviews.json
```

* ```review```: hash with the review params
  * ```place_id```: integer for the respective place id
